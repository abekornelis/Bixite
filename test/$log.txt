22-04-11 Define syntax to replace .xxh components with a single unit
         defining required elements for each language xx.
         Definitions:
         - component named on label, not on pos.parm 1
         - command identifier: a dot in column one
         - language codes: 2 characters in column 1-2
           or blanks to indicate continuation. Defined language codes
           de deutsch    = german
           es español    = spanish
           fr francais   = french
           fy frysk      = frysian
           it italiano   = italian
           nl nederlands = dutch
           uk english    = english
           xx not applicable / all languages
         - Defined commands:
           .site  for site page belongs to
           .title for page title
           .desc  for description
Time:    01:00 (20:15-21:15)

23-04-11 Define syntax to replace .xxh components with a single unit
         --> in columns 1-3 to indicate a link to another location
         .keys  for keywords
         .var   for named variables
         Macro HTMLDEF changed to add support for new type of
         definition, including support for new syntax.
         Macro STRIP changed to strip either leading spaces, trailing
         spaces, or both leading and trailing spaces (default)
         Copy member $Defaults added
         .lang   for valid languages defined
         Macro HTMLHEAD modified to include $Defaults before all else
         Macro HTMLHEAD modified to either generate AINSERTs for
         retrieving definitions, or to generate actual html
Time:    04:30 (11:00-12:00, 14:00-17:30)

24-04-11 Modify macro HTMLHEAD to cause HTMLBODY to get executed
         Modify macro HTMLBODY to cause HTMLHEAD TYPE=GEN and
         HTMLPUN TYPE=PUNCH to get executed
         --> HTMLHEAD logic is getting unnecessarily complex:
         Create macro HTMLPAGE to replace initial HTMLHEAD
         Modify macro HTMLBODY to behave according to 'old' logic
         if the type of page is not set in the new way (global var)
         Modify HTMLHEAD to generate heading using data from the
         the new definitions; modify HTMLPUN to accept data with
         TYPE=HEAD
Time:    03:30 (11:00-12:00, 16:30-18:00, 19:30-20:30)

24-04-11 Continue adding data to copy member DEFAULTS in order to
         generate a proper header, in the new way.
         Lots of modifications for macro HTMLPUN to mimic existing
         way of breaking various types of statements.
         --> Creating generic logic for lay-outing the source
             postponed until later. One thing at a time.
         .changed for last change date added at the page level, site
                  level, and a general default
         Modify macro HTMLDEF to support language definitions with
         two parameters: language codes (nl, en-gb) and directory name
         .css     for specifying css style sheet filename, either as
                  site default, or specific for a page
         Modify bixoft (root page) accordingly.
         Regression test shows all html pages assemble ok, but the
         css and .htaccess files do not.
         Root pages cannot easily be fit into the new schema either.
Time:    04:30 (9:50-10:50, 13:20-15:20, 16:55-17:25, 19:30-20:00)

25-04-11 Issue for css and .htaccess files resolved by modifying
         macro HTMLPAGE - now expects filename and type, where
         type defaults to html if unspecified.
         .root-components defined to for specifying components to
         use for a page in the site's root. Macro HTMLDEF modified
         accordingly. HTMLBODY modified to use the associated var.
Time:    02:15 (8:30-9:30, 16:15-16:45, 21:15-22:00)

26-04-11 Modify HTMLHEAD, HTMLBODY to correctly handle .site root
         while generating header data and body components.
         Modify HTMLDEF to support dual argument on .site syntax:
         site-designation[,logical_site] second argument for root pages
         .title_owner defined for overriding default owner for title
Time:     (07:50-09:15, 19:40-20:10. 20:25-20:40)
